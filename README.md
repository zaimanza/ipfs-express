# ipfs-express
An implementation of a distributed file storage using IPFS. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

In IPFS, files are not stored in a centralized server. This prevents any corporates of owning and controlling the files. Instead, any computer can act as a Node to Pin the files and save on their computer (Node). Whenever the user wants to access the file, they can simply fetch data from any Node that has their Decentralized Identifier (DID).
